# Wellness-Front

Wellness-Front is an Angular app where we do a CRUD from invoices.

## Tech

wellness-front uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

- [Angular] - HTML enhanced for web apps!
- [markdown-it] - Markdown parser done right. Fast and easy to extend.
- [Bootstrap] - great UI boilerplate for modern web apps

And of course wellness-front itself is open source with a [public repository][wellnes-front]
 on GitHub.

## Installation

wellness-front requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v10+ to run.

Install the dependencies and devDependencies and start the server.

```sh
cd wellness-front
npm i
ng serve
```
